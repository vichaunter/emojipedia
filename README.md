# Emojipedia the ultimate emojis site

Yes! It's Adds Free! how cannot be butter?!!

## Motivation

This project is the antagonist of all that fuzzy pages full of adds that promises you to provide
emojis, but ends being a nest of crypto mining, cookie stealing, ads bombarding and scam phishing sites.

Here you can just come, search in real time for any emoji you want, copy it and use it.

I've "hand crafted" the list of all known emojis by categories, with names, descriptions, classified with
tags to make better search and so on. So you can have the experience I expect when i arrive to any emoji site,
smooth and useful.

Of course have in mind that there can be maybe some new emojis that were not when I've created the site
so feel free to report them to be included opening a ticket or a PR! If it fits, will be accepted üòâ

## What I used to build this project is

- **[Vite](https://vitejs.dev/):** A fast and lightweight build tool that provides an excellent development experience.
- **[React](https://reactjs.org/):** A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/):** A superset of JavaScript that adds static type definitions for better developer tooling and safer code.
- **[Vitest](https://vitest.dev/):** A blazing fast unit testing framework designed for Vite.
- **[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/):** A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom designs.
- **Icons**: nah, it's a joke, I've used only emojis instead of icons, that is why some of them can be not a perfect fit ü§´.

## How to use it?

You can just go to the site that I have published, or follow this steps to clone and run it locally:

Have in mind that you need node with npm/yarn/pnpm installed and use terminal

```
git clone this repo
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

```
yarn install
yarn dev
```

```
npm install
npm dev
```

that's it, just to run it locally or develop on it is enough, if you want to build it check packages.json

## Testing

Just running this command you can run tests

```
pnpm test
```

In the point of writing this almost 100% of the code had test coverage, even if is a simple project I wanted
to have it covered so can be inspiration for others, or even used as boilerplate.

## Notes

If you want to collaborate, feel free to open a PR, comment or open tickets.

Even if I tried to make it as clean and following conventions and good practices as possible, have in mind that
this was a Saturday afternoon chill project, so was very little time invested on it üòù so if you find bugs, or something
can be done better in a different way, just ping me out.
